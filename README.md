# Brew Volley

This is my entry for the N64brew Game Jam #4 (a.k.a N64brew Summer Game Jam). It is badly coded, physics is *really* janky, and the result is a far cry from the MVP I ensivionned... Yet I figure it's worth getting the code out there.

The game requires two controllers.
It has been tested on a PAL N64 console and with CEN64, but there is an issue with Ares (the countdown will eventually break).
